Dear Autonomous team,


  Please consider my application for the Web Engineering Intern opportunity. I'm
passionate for music and have an ambition to develop great experience to music
listeners. I believe Spotify creates a great experience for all users at all times.
With the Spotify app, people across the world are impacted in the way they
experiences music. As a Software Engineer, I'm exited to collaborate closely with
other engineers and become a valued member of an autonomous, cross-functional team.
 	 I have a background in business, management and sales. I leaded a multicultural
sales team and operated a complex logistic, accomplished rewards costumer service
program designed to reach production goals. Currently on a Full Stack Web
Development immersive program, I'm building multiple full stack apps, working with
clients on a dev team, and continuing to make contributions to open source softwares.
  The project that I’m working on now, for people with disabilities with
visual dashboard of where a person stands with regard to their benefits, so that
they are constantly ahead of making a mistake and earning too much. Keys of the
project are mobile design, web accessibility, and security. We are using the most
advanced UI framework, modern web app with React UI components.
  With fluency in JavaScript, React and Python, the position with Spotify seems to
offer an excellent career opportunity. I noted the qualifications you are looking
for, and I feel that I am the right individual for your organization. I’m also
excited about being exposed to the different aspects of your business operation
and learning the practical side. 


Sincerely yours,


Robson Farias
